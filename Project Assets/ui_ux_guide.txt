2. Button Behaviors
The "Pay Now" button must always be green (class: btn-primary).
"Add to Cart" buttons should be blue to differentiate from the final checkout action.
During the 'Processing' state (after click), the button must be disabled to prevent double

Validation must occur on "Submit" (click of Pay Now button).
Invalid Inputs:
-The input border must turn red (#dc2626).
-A helper text message must appear directly below the failed input field.
-The helper text must be red.

4. Success Feedback
Upon successful validation and simulated processing:
Do NOT redirect the user.

Text content: "Payment Successful!"
Background color: Light Green (#dcfce7).

5. Responsive Layout
Desktop (>768px): Two-column layout. Left column = Cart/Products; Right column = Form.
