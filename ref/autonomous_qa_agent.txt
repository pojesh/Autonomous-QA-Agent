Assignment: Development of an Autonomous QA Agent for Test Case and Script Generation 
Assignment: Development of an Autonomous QA Agent 
for Test Case and Script Generation 
Objective 
Build an intelligent, autonomous QA agent capable of constructing a “testing brain” from project 
documentation. The system will ingest support documents (e.g., product specifications, UI/UX 
guidelines, mock APIs) alongside the HTML structure of a target web project. Using these inputs, the 
agent should: 
• Generate Test Cases — Produce comprehensive, documentation-grounded test plans and 
test viewpoints. 
• Generate Selenium Test Scripts — Convert the generated test cases into executable Python 
Selenium scripts for automated testing. 
The backend must be implemented using FastAPI or Flask, with a Streamlit user interface. 
All test reasoning must be grounded strictly in the provided documents—no hallucinated features. 
Submission Guidelines 
Candidates must provide: 
1. Source Code Repository (GitHub/GitLab/etc.) 
2. README.md including: 
o Setup instructions (Python version, dependencies) 
o How to run FastAPI/Flask + Streamlit 
o Usage examples 
o Explanation of the included support documents 
3. Project Assets 
o The checkout.html file 
o The 3–5 support documents used. 
4. Demo Video (5–10 minutes) demonstrating: 
o Uploading documents + HTML 
o Building the knowledge base 
o Generating test cases 
o Selecting a test case 
o Generating Selenium scripts

Assignment: Development of an Autonomous QA Agent for Test Case and Script Generation 
Evaluation Criteria 
1. Functionality 
• Does the system fulfill all phases (ingestion → test cases → script generation)? 
2. Knowledge Grounding 
• Are test cases based strictly on provided documents? 
• No hallucinations or fabricated features. 
3. Script Quality 
• Are Selenium scripts clean, correct, and runnable? 
• Do selectors match the actual HTML? 
4. Code Quality 
• Modular, readable, well-structured code 
• Clean backend with FastAPI/Flask + Streamlit interface 
5. User Experience 
• Simple, intuitive UI 
• Clear system feedback (e.g., “Knowledge Base Built,” “Generating Script…”) 
6. Documentation 
• Clear, detailed README.md 
• Instructions for setup, dependencies, and usage

Project Assets (To Be Created or Provided) 
Your assignment will focus on a simple, single-page web application and a set of support 
documents. 
1. Target Web Project (checkout.html) 
A single-page “E-Shop Checkout” HTML file containing: 
Features (5–10 items) 
• 2–3 items with “Add to Cart” buttons 
• A cart summary section with item quantity inputs and total price 
• A discount code input field 
• A User Details form (Name, Email, Address) 
• Form validation with inline error messages (e.g., invalid email, required fields) 
• Shipping method radio buttons (Standard, Express) 
• Payment method radio buttons (Credit Card, PayPal) 
• A “Pay Now” button that, if the form is valid, displays “Payment Successful!” 
2. Support Documents (3–5 files) 
Examples include: 
1. product_specs.md 
• Contains feature rules—for example: 
• “The discount code SAVE15 applies a 15% discount.” 
• “Express shipping costs $10; Standard shipping is free.” 
2. ui_ux_guide.txt 
• Contains UI/UX guidelines—for example: 
• “Form validation errors must be displayed in red text.” 
• “The ‘Pay Now’ button should be green.” 
3. api_endpoints.json (optional but recommended) 
• Example: 
{ 
"POST /apply_coupon": {"code": "string"}, 
"POST /submit_order": {"name": "string", "email": "string"} 
}

Functional Requirements 
Phase 1: Knowledge Base Ingestion & UI (Streamlit) 
Required UI Features 
The Streamlit UI must allow users to: 
1. Upload support documents (MD, TXT, JSON, PDF, etc.) 
2. Upload or paste the checkout.html file 
3. Click “Build Knowledge Base” 
Content Parsing 
Use appropriate libraries to extract text from documents, such as: 
• unstructured 
• pymupdf (fitz) 
• Custom parsers for JSON, HTML, etc. 
Vector Database Ingestion 
• Implement text chunking (e.g., RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter) 
• Preserve metadata (e.g., "source_document": "product_specs.md") 
• Generate embeddings using a model such as those from Hugging Face 
• Store vectors + metadata in a vector DB (Chroma, FAISS, Qdrant, etc.) 
Phase 2: Test Case Generation Agent 
UI 
Provide an “Agent” section where the user can request test cases. 
Example prompt: 
“Generate all positive and negative test cases for the discount code feature.” 
RAG Pipeline 
1. Embed the user’s query 
2. Retrieve relevant chunks from the vector database 
3. Feed retrieved context + user query into an LLM (Ollama, Groq, local HF model, etc.) 
LLM Output Requirements 
The agent must respond with structured test plans in JSON or Markdown table format.

Assignment: Development of an Autonomous QA Agent for Test Case and Script Generation 
Example Test Case Output 
Test_ID: TC-001 
Feature: Discount Code 
Test_Scenario: Apply a valid discount code 'SAVE15'. 
Expected_Result: Total price is reduced by 15%. 
Grounded_In: product_specs.md 
All test reasoning must reference the source document(s). 
Phase 3: Selenium Script Generation Agent 
Extend the UI to allow: 
• Selecting one of the generated test cases 
• Clicking “Generate Selenium Script” 
Agent Logic 
The agent must: 
1. Receive the selected test case 
2. Retrieve the full content of checkout.html 
3. Retrieve relevant documentation snippets from the vector DB 
4. Use an LLM to generate a runnable Selenium Python script 
Prompt Requirements 
The LLM must be instructed to: 
• Act as a Selenium (Python) expert 
• Use appropriate selectors (IDs, names, CSS selectors) based on the actual HTML 
• Produce high-quality, fully executable code 
Output 
Display the generated Python script in a code block for easy copying.
